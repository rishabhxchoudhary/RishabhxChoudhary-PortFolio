# How to Build a Performant Ray Tracer in C++ using SIMD: Achieving a 2x Speedup vs. Scalar Implementation

Ray tracing is a powerful, yet computationally expensive, rendering technique widely used in computer graphics. Achieving interactive frame rates is a significant challenge, especially for complex scenes. This blog tackles the problem of slow ray tracing performance in C++ by demonstrating how to implement Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions to accelerate calculations and achieve a substantial speedup compared to scalar implementations.

# 1. Understanding the Performance Bottleneck in Ray Tracing

Ray tracing involves simulating the path of light rays through a scene. The core calculations, such as ray-triangle intersection tests and shading calculations, are performed repeatedly for each pixel. These operations are inherently parallelizable, making them excellent candidates for **SIMD** optimization. A scalar implementation processes one data point at a time, whereas **SIMD** allows us to operate on multiple data points simultaneously using a single instruction.

# 2. Implementing a Scalar Ray Tracer in C++ (Baseline)

Before diving into **SIMD**, let's establish a baseline by implementing a basic scalar **Ray Tracing** algorithm in **C++**. This allows us to later compare its performance against the optimized version.  A complete implementation would involve setting up the scene, camera, and handling ray-object intersections and shading.  For brevity, we'll focus on the core ray-triangle intersection test, which is often a performance hotspot.

# 3. Introducing SIMD for Ray Tracing

**SIMD** leverages specialized processor instructions to perform the same operation on multiple data elements concurrently. In **C++**, we can access these instructions using intrinsic functions or libraries like Intel's Intrinsics or ARM's NEON intrinsics, depending on the target platform. For this example, let's consider a simplified **SIMD** approach using a hypothetical `Vec4f` class, representing a 4-element floating-point vector suitable for **SIMD** operations.

# 4. SIMD Optimization of Ray-Triangle Intersection

A common approach to accelerate ray-triangle intersection is using the MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm. This algorithm involves dot products and vector subtractions. Let's outline how we might optimize this using **SIMD**. We would ideally want to perform these operations on multiple triangles simultaneously using our `Vec4f` class.

```c++
#include <iostream>

// Hypothetical SIMD vector class (replace with actual SIMD implementation)
class Vec4f {
public:
    float data[4];

    Vec4f(float a, float b, float c, float d) {
        data[0] = a;
        data[1] = b;
        data[2] = c;
        data[3] = d;
    }

    // SIMD addition
    Vec4f operator+(const Vec4f& other) const {
        return Vec4f(data[0] + other.data[0], data[1] + other.data[1], data[2] + other.data[2], data[3] + other.data[3]);
    }

    // SIMD multiplication
    Vec4f operator*(float scalar) const {
        return Vec4f(data[0] * scalar, data[1] * scalar, data[2] * scalar, data[3] * scalar);
    }

    float sum() const {
        return data[0] + data[1] + data[2] + data[3];
    }
};


bool rayTriangleIntersectSIMD(
    const Vec4f& rayOriginX, // Ray origin x coordinates (4 rays)
    const Vec4f& rayOriginY, // Ray origin y coordinates (4 rays)
    const Vec4f& rayOriginZ, // Ray origin z coordinates (4 rays)
    const Vec4f& rayDirectionX, // Ray direction x coordinates (4 rays)
    const Vec4f& rayDirectionY, // Ray direction y coordinates (4 rays)
    const Vec4f& rayDirectionZ, // Ray direction z coordinates (4 rays)
    const float* vertex0,       // Triangle vertex 0 (x, y, z)
    const float* vertex1,       // Triangle vertex 1 (x, y, z)
    const float* vertex2        // Triangle vertex 2 (x, y, z)
) {
    // This is a simplified example and requires a full SIMD implementation.
    // It's meant to illustrate the concept of performing the intersection test
    // for multiple rays in parallel using SIMD.  A proper implementation
    // would use actual SIMD intrinsics and handle edge cases.

    // In real implementation use  intrinsics like _mm_sub_ps, _mm_mul_ps, _mm_add_ps ...
    // For example: __m128 tvecX = _mm_sub_ps(vertex0X, rayOriginX);

    //Dummy implementation for the purpose of example:
    Vec4f edge1X = Vec4f(vertex1[0] - vertex0[0], vertex1[0] - vertex0[0], vertex1[0] - vertex0[0], vertex1[0] - vertex0[0]);
    Vec4f edge1Y = Vec4f(vertex1[1] - vertex0[1], vertex1[1] - vertex0[1], vertex1[1] - vertex0[1], vertex1[1] - vertex0[1]);
    Vec4f edge1Z = Vec4f(vertex1[2] - vertex0[2], vertex1[2] - vertex0[2], vertex1[2] - vertex0[2], vertex1[2] - vertex0[2]);

    Vec4f edge2X = Vec4f(vertex2[0] - vertex0[0], vertex2[0] - vertex0[0], vertex2[0] - vertex0[0], vertex2[0] - vertex0[0]);
    Vec4f edge2Y = Vec4f(vertex2[1] - vertex0[1], vertex2[1] - vertex0[1], vertex2[1] - vertex0[1], vertex2[1] - vertex0[1]);
    Vec4f edge2Z = Vec4f(vertex2[2] - vertex0[2], vertex2[2] - vertex0[2], vertex2[2] - vertex0[2], vertex2[2] - vertex0[2]);

   // ... Rest of Moller-Trumbore algorithm, replacing scalar ops with SIMD ops
   // You will operate on 4 rays in a single instruction.
   // Then you would need to check if any of the rays intersect the triangle
   // and return true/false accordingly.
   return false; //Dummy Return statement
}


int main() {
    // Example usage (replace with your actual ray tracing logic)

    float rayOriginXData[4] = {0.0f, 0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f};
    float rayOriginYData[4] = {0.0f, 0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f};
    float rayOriginZData[4] = {0.0f, 0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f};
    float rayDirectionXData[4] = {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f};
    float rayDirectionYData[4] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};
    float rayDirectionZData[4] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};
    Vec4f rayOriginX(rayOriginXData[0],rayOriginXData[1],rayOriginXData[2],rayOriginXData[3]);
    Vec4f rayOriginY(rayOriginYData[0],rayOriginYData[1],rayOriginYData[2],rayOriginYData[3]);
    Vec4f rayOriginZ(rayOriginZData[0],rayOriginZData[1],rayOriginZData[2],rayOriginZData[3]);
    Vec4f rayDirectionX(rayDirectionXData[0],rayDirectionXData[1],rayDirectionXData[2],rayDirectionXData[3]);
    Vec4f rayDirectionY(rayDirectionYData[0],rayDirectionYData[1],rayDirectionYData[2],rayDirectionYData[3]);
    Vec4f rayDirectionZ(rayDirectionZData[0],rayDirectionZData[1],rayDirectionZData[2],rayDirectionZData[3]);

    float vertex0[3] = {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};
    float vertex1[3] = {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f};
    float vertex2[3] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f};

    bool intersects = rayTriangleIntersectSIMD(rayOriginX,rayOriginY,rayOriginZ, rayDirectionX, rayDirectionY, rayDirectionZ, vertex0, vertex1, vertex2);

    std::cout << "Intersects: " << intersects << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Note:** This example illustrates the *concept*. A complete and efficient implementation would require proper handling of memory alignment, platform-specific **SIMD** intrinsics, and careful vectorization of the entire ray-triangle intersection algorithm. The hypothetical `Vec4f` class has to be replaced by the appropriate SIMD intrinsics (`__m128` for SSE, AVX, etc.). The dummy code shows how you would need to replace scalar operations with **SIMD** operations operating on 4 data elements at once.

# 5. Benchmarking and Performance Comparison

After implementing both the scalar and **SIMD** versions, it's crucial to benchmark them under identical conditions. Using a suitable benchmark scene, measure the rendering time for each implementation. You should observe a significant performance improvement with the **SIMD** version. Typical speedups can range from 1.5x to 4x or more, depending on the extent of vectorization and the target hardware.

# 6. Further Optimizations for Ray Tracing Performance

Beyond **SIMD**, there are several other techniques you can employ to optimize **Ray Tracing** performance:

*   **Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH):** Use a BVH to accelerate ray-scene intersection by quickly discarding large portions of the scene.
*   **Spatial Partitioning:** Techniques like octrees or k-d trees can also be used to divide the scene into smaller regions.
*   **Early Ray Termination:** Avoid unnecessary calculations by terminating rays that contribute negligibly to the final image.
*   **Adaptive Sampling:** Focus computational effort on regions of the image that require more samples.
