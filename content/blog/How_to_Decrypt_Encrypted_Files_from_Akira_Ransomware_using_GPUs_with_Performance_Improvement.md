# How to Decrypt Encrypted Files from Akira Ransomware using GPUs with Performance Improvement

Ransomware attacks, like those from Akira, pose a significant threat to data security. This blog will address the challenge of decrypting files encrypted by Akira Ransomware without paying the ransom, leveraging the power of GPUs for faster decryption.

# 1. Understanding Akira Ransomware

Akira Ransomware uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to lock files. Typically, it employs the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm for symmetric encryption and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) for asymmetric encryption. 

When a file is encrypted, Akira generates a random AES key, encrypts the file with this key, and then encrypts the AES key with the victim's public RSA key. The encrypted AES key is stored alongside the encrypted file. 

To decrypt the file, you need the private RSA key to decrypt the AES key, and then use the AES key to decrypt the file. 

# 2. GPU Acceleration for Decryption

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are highly parallel processors that can perform many calculations simultaneously. This makes them ideal for tasks like decryption, which involve repetitive operations.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Extract Encrypted Data**: Read the encrypted file and extract the encrypted AES key and the encrypted file data.
2. **RSA Decryption**: Use the private RSA key to decrypt the AES key. This step is computationally intensive but can be parallelized.
3. **AES Decryption**: Use the decrypted AES key to decrypt the file data. This step can also benefit from parallel processing.

### Python Code Example using PyCUDA

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
from pycuda.compiler import SourceModule
import numpy as np
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

# Sample RSA private key and encrypted AES key (for demonstration purposes)
private_key = RSA.generate(2048)
encrypted_aes_key = private_key.encrypt(b"sample_aes_key", 32)[0]

# Decrypt RSA key using GPU
mod = SourceModule("""
__global__ void rsa_decrypt(unsigned char *enc_key, unsigned char *dec_key, int key_size) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < key_size) {
        // Placeholder for actual RSA decryption logic
        dec_key[idx] = enc_key[idx]; 
    }
}
""")

rsa_decrypt = mod.get_function("rsa_decrypt")

enc_key_gpu = cuda.mem_alloc(encrypted_aes_key.nbytes)
dec_key_gpu = cuda.mem_alloc(encrypted_aes_key.nbytes)
cuda.memcpy_htod(enc_key_gpu, np.frombuffer(encrypted_aes_key, dtype=np.uint8))

block_size = 32
n_blocks = int(np.ceil(len(encrypted_aes_key) / float(block_size)))
rsa_decrypt(enc_key_gpu, dec_key_gpu, np.int32(len(encrypted_aes_key)), 
            block=(block_size, 1, 1), grid=(n_blocks, 1))

dec_key = np.empty_like(encrypted_aes_key, dtype=np.uint8)
cuda.memcpy_dtoh(dec_key, dec_key_gpu)
decrypted_aes_key = dec_key.tobytes()

# Decrypt AES using CPU (for simplicity)
cipher = AES.new(decrypted_aes_key, AES.MODE_ECB)
encrypted_file_data = b"encrypted_file_data"  # Placeholder for actual encrypted file data
decrypted_file_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_file_data)

print("Decrypted file data:", decrypted_file_data)
```

### Performance Improvement

Using GPUs for RSA decryption can significantly reduce the time required to decrypt the AES key. The parallel nature of GPU processing allows for faster computation compared to traditional CPU-based methods.
